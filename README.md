## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/qdt-text.git
cd qdt-text
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📚 Data Preparation

1. Create a `data` directory:
```bash
mkdir data
```

2. Add your text files to the `data` directory. The model supports multiple text files for training.

## 🚀 Usage

1. Train the model:
```bash
python train_text_model.py
```

2. The script will:
   - Process and analyze your text databases
   - Build a vocabulary
   - Train the QDT-Enhanced model
   - Save checkpoints and training history
   - Generate sample text during training

3. Generate text using the trained model:
```python
from qdt_text_model import QDTTextGenerator, TextDatabase

# Load the trained model
model = QDTTextGenerator.load_from_checkpoint('models/text_model/best_model.pth')

# Generate text
prompt = "The quantum crystal"
generated_text, metrics = model.generate_text(
    prompt,
    max_length=100,
    temperature=0.8,
    mode='word',
    top_k=50,
    top_p=0.9
)
print(generated_text)
```

## 🔬 QDT Theory

The model implements Quantum Duality Theory with the following constants:
- λ (Lambda) = 0.867: Coupling constant
- γ (Gamma) = 0.4497: Damping coefficient
- β (Beta) = 0.310: Fractal recursion
- η (Eta) = 0.520: Momentum coefficient
- φ (Phi) = 1.618033: Golden ratio

## 📈 Training Phases

1. **Crystal Initialization**: Setting up quantum states
2. **Quantum Tunneling**: Initial exploration phase
3. **Gravitational Funneling**: Knowledge consolidation
4. **Harmonic Resonance**: Learning equilibrium
5. **Transcendent Integration**: Final optimization

## 🎯 Results

The model achieves exceptional performance through:
- Dynamic learning rate adaptation
- Void-Filament energy balance
- Crystal-enhanced coherence
- Temporal pattern recognition
- Semantic resonance
